# Node.js Simple Backend API Challenge

**Creator:** XYZ
**Source/Author:** ChatGPT

## Prerequisites

- Basic JavaScript and Node.js
- Express.js
- MongoDB (or any other database of your choice)
- Basic knowledge of RESTful API principles

## The Tech

- Node.js
- Express.js (for creating the API)
- MongoDB (for storing data; you can use Mongoose for easier interaction)
- Postman or any other API testing tool

## The Challenge

Create a simple backend API to manage a collection of resources (e.g., articles, tasks, or any other entity). This challenge will help to understand your thinking process and judge your skill level.

### For Beginner Level

#### CRUD Operations on a Simple Resource (e.g., Articles, Tasks)

- **Create Resource:** Add a new resource.
- **Get All Resources:** Retrieve all resources.
- **Get Resource by ID:** Retrieve a specific resource by its ID.
- **Update Resource:** Update a specific resource.
- **Delete Resource:** Delete a specific resource.

#### Bonus Points

- **Search Functionality:** Implement a search endpoint to find resources by title or content.

### For Intermediate Level

#### CRUD Operations on a Simple Resource (e.g., Articles, Tasks)

- **Create Resource:** Add a new resource.
- **Get All Resources:** Retrieve all resources.
- **Get Resource by ID:** Retrieve a specific resource by its ID.
- **Update Resource:** Update a specific resource.
- **Delete Resource:** Delete a specific resource.

#### User Authentication

- **Sign Up:** Create a new user account.
- **Login:** Authenticate a user and return a token.
- **Logout:** Log out a user (invalidate the token).

#### Bonus Points

- **Get User Profile:** Retrieve the authenticated user's profile
- **Search Functionality:** Implement a search endpoint to find resources by title or content.

### For Advanced Level

#### CRUD Operations on a Simple Resource (e.g., Articles, Tasks)

- **Create Resource:** Add a new resource.
- **Get All Resources:** Retrieve all resources.
- **Get Resource by ID:** Retrieve a specific resource by its ID.
- **Update Resource:** Update a specific resource.
- **Delete Resource:** Delete a specific resource.

#### User Authentication

- **Sign Up:** Create a new user account.
- **Login:** Authenticate a user and return a token.
- **Logout:** Log out a user (invalidate the token).

#### Bonus Points

- **Get User Profile:** Retrieve the authenticated user's profile.
- **Token Refresh:** Implement a token refresh mechanism to allow users to obtain a new token without re-authenticating.
- **Password Reset:** Implement a password reset functionality.
- **Search Functionality:** Implement a search endpoint to find resources by title or content.

## Deadline (Optional)

- It's optional and it's decided by the author.
- If a timeline is given, please specify the time required for peer review.

## Deliverables (Optional)

- Deploy the API on a platform like [Render](https://render.com/), [Railway](https://railway.app/), or any other cloud service.
- Submit the code in a GitHub repository and post it under your name in the [Members Attempting](#members-attempting) section so others can access it for peer review and final submission.
