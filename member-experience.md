# Member Experience Directory

## Adding Your Experience to the Directory

Share your expertise in the tech field with other Virtual Coffee members by adding an entry to our directory! Include your name, experience level, current and/or previous job titles, and each role's duties and tasks. See below for more details on each section.

### Name

Please include your name. If your Slack handle is different from your name, include that too, so other VC members can easily contact you.

### Experience Level

Describe your overall experience level. Include past experience, regardless of time gap – it's still valuable experience, and any transferrable skills from another industry.

### Job Titles

Give us your official job title, then briefly describe what you **_actually_** do/did. Many roles have a title that inaccurately describes the day-to-day, which is what we're seeking to uncover. If your position has a corresponding level of experience, please list that here as well.

### Job Duties and Tasks

Please list technical and non-technical tasks in this section. Include any specific technologies used as an industry standard in this role. When making this list, imagine that you're preparing for your annual review and want to show your manager you've been 10x _your job title here_ this year!

## Viewing this Directory

<!-- We need to add some content here. I think right now we're limited to Command/Alt + F page search. A great challenge would be to build out an API to facilitate this! -->
